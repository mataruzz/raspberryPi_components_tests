# Raspberry Pi Basic Component Interaction

Welcome to the **Raspberry Pi Basic Component Interaction** repository! This repository is designed to be a valuable resource for integrating fundamental components with the Raspberry Pi 3B+. The main objective is to comprehend the operational principles of these elements, enabling their utilization in constructing a <a href="https://www.keyestudio.com/products/keyestudio-raspberry-pi-smart-car-robot-kit5-megapixels-camera-module-python-programming-for-raspberry-pi-4bno-raspberry-pi-board-">miniatur car</a> equipped with four **DC motors, three servo motors, and a single ultrasonic sensor**.



## What You'll Find

Inside this repository, you'll explore the following fundamental components:

- **HC-SR04 Ultrasound**: Testing how to effectively measure distances and detect obstacles using high-frequency sound waves.

- **SG90 Servomotor**: Testing how to manipulate the position of a servomotor using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals.

- ## **TO DO: add DC_motor information**

## Getting Started

Each component has a dedicated python script and an informative guide, designed to facilitate and explain the setup. 

## Future Prospects

This repository is just the beginning of a journey to build and control a mini car, being able to communicate with Raspberry Pi GPIO modules in ***ROS2***.\
The underlying concept is to grasp the functioning of individual components, get them operational, and subsequently integrate them cohesively, with the ultimate aim of incorporating the entire system into ROS2.

Contributions, feedback, and shared experiences are welcomed.
